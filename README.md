# SobczyksWeatherDash

This is a weather dashboard created using Javascript. Elements of JQuery, Moment.js, and bootstrap were used in the creation of the page. The weather data is gathered using the API's at https://openweathermap.org/.

In using this webpage, a user can type in the name of a city, and it will show a main weather card showing the current weather. The current weather card includes the city name, the date, the temperature, windspeed, humidity, an icon representing the weather, and UV Index.

Searches are saved in local storage and are persistent on reload. If a user clicks on one of the saved searches, it will re-submit the search for that city again.

At the bottom of the page there is a 5 day forecast for the current city selected in the search.
